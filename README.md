I forgot my 5-digit locker combination, but have a set of hints I left for myself that should be helpful. Write a simple program that can quickly check the possible combinations using the hints below and print out what my password is.

The product of the first two digits is 24.
The fourth digit is one-third of the second digit.
The sum of the last two digits are the same as the sum of the first and third digits.
The sum of all the digits is 26.
Not all the digits are unique
